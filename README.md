### **Authored** by Hugo Gamboa

### **Contributed** by João Rodrigues

A set of ipython notebooks include the code to generate the figures of the presentation. The [data](data/) directory contains .txt files in tab separated values with the signals. 

Some signals examples can also be found in [OpenSignals](http://biosignalsplux.com/en/learn/signal-samples)

Some **figures** have been generated in [Inkscape](www.inkscape.org) and exist in the directory [inkscape](/figures/inkscape) in svg or pdf. The remaining figures have been generated in python and can be found in the folder [figures](/figures) in their corresponding presentation path.
