A set of ipython notebooks include the code to generate the figures of the presentation. The [data](data/) directory contains .txt files in tab separated values with the signals. 

Some signals examples can also be found in [OpenSignals](http://biosignalsplux.com/en/learn/signal-samples)

Some ***figures*** have been generated in [Inkscape](www.inkscape.org) and exist in the directory [figures](/images) in svg or pdf.
